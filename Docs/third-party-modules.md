# 3rd Party Modules in Use

The following are the 3rd party modules I'm using in my deployment.

## [Contrib.Podcasts](https://github.com/andrewconnell/contrib.podcasts)

## [Contrib.RewriteRules](http://orchardrewriterules.codeplex.com)

This module adds rewrite rules to your website using Apache `.htaccess` file format.

## [SH.GoogleAnalytics](https://github.com/ScharfHoldings/SH.GoogleAnalytics)

The Google Analytics module enables the ability to automatically include the Google Analytics tracking script on every page using simple configuration settings. Options include the use of either the legacy tracking js code or the new asynchronous tracking js code, allowing multiple sub/domain support, and turning off tracking for admin pages. Please fork, contribute or submit bugs/issues on GitHub @ [https://github.com/ScharfHoldings/SH.GoogleAnalytics]. More about Scharf Holdings, LLC can be found at http://www.scharfholdings.com.

## [SH.Robots](https://github.com/ScharfHoldings/SH.Robots)
Provides a way to define and modify the robots.txt file at the site root through configuration. robots.txt is served through the pipeline dynamically rather than as a static txt file. Please fork, contribute or report bugs on GitHub at [https://github.com/ScharfHoldings/SH.Robots].
